# GIT TEST FILE

'''
Hi Guys, this is a quick file to just get used to this version and application of github.
I think there are seriously only two options of git that we need to get faimliar with to
utilize this resource.

I chose python as I am confident that all of us have an IDE capable of running python scripts.

We can use this file as quick tutorial of git.

To do : Below you see two blocks of print statements. In the first block add you name and push
		the code to the same branch.

		For the second block, create a new branch, add you name and merge your code into the 
		previous branch.

		The final output of our efforts should look like this:

		print 'Names added to same branch:'
		print 'Akshay Shankar'
		print 'Nam Cuong'
		print 'Jordan Miller'

		print 'Names merged in from different branch:'
		print 'Shankar Akshay'
		print 'Cuong Nam'
		print 'Miller Jordan'
'''

print 'Names added to same branch:'
print 'Akshay Shankar'
print ''
print 'Jordan Miller'


print 'Names merged in from different branch:'
print 'Shankar Akshay'
print ''
print ''
